    output from the new `toJSON` method)
  - Changed `toTaskStateFromStateLike` function to handle new `type` property & still survive a legacy `kind` property

  - Added new `detachSubTask` function to enable a sub-task to be detached from its parent task
  - Changed `getOrCreateSubTask` function to replace an existing unusable sub-task with a usable version by detaching 
    the old unusable sub-task, creating the new sub-task via `createSubTask` & updating the new from the old
  - & to create a 
    new sub-task, both with new sub-task definitions created with defaulted to true if 
    not explicitly set

    unusable tasks, first updated from their prior versions & then reset
  - Changed `reconstructTaskDefsFromRootTaskLike` function to properly generate placeholder `doNotExecute` functions 
    (which are also now marked with `placeholder` properties set to true) using the new inner `generatePlaceholderFunction` 
    function and to mark all reconstructed task definitions & sub-task definitions as `unusable`

### 6.0.2-alpha1
- Started integrating unusable task definition changes from 4.0.8

### 6.0.1
- Changes to `tasks` module & `Task` class:
  - Fixed behaviour of `reject`, `discard`, `abandon` & `rejectAs` methods to first recurse through sub-tasks, to ONLY 
    allow the state change if the task is incomplete AND every one of it sub-task is fully finalised & to return the 
    number of tasks & sub-tasks actually rejected. Rationale for change: Should NOT be able to reject a task with 
    incomplete sub-tasks
  - Added new `discardIfOverAttempted` method, which is a variation of the `discard` method, that first recurses through 
    the task's sub-tasks, ONLY allows the state change if the task is incomplete, OVER-ATTEMPTED AND every one of its 
    sub-task is fully finalised & finally returns the number of tasks & sub-tasks actually rejected
- Changes to `task-factory` module:
  - Changed the behaviour of the `updateTask` function to use `Try.findFailure` to do a much deeper search for a Failure 
    instead of only checking the top-level result for a Failure

    - Set the master task's state to the "least advanced" state of all of its slave tasks (if its undefined or unstarted)
  - Removed redundant dependency on `deep-equal` module

    - Renamed `_error` property to `error`

    superclass constructor

    description of a task's `execute` arguments to use for logging & to pass to the `updateTask` method
  - Changed the `updateTask` method to accept an extra `startTimeInMs` argument to use to calculate `end` time

  - Changes to `complete` and `succeed` methods:
    - Replaced 2nd `overrideTimedOut` boolean argument with a more generic object `opts` argument, which currently only 
      accepts an `overrideTimedOut` property. For backward compatibility, any boolean `opts` argument will be treated as 
      a legacy `overrideTimedOut` argument
  - Changes to `completeAs` method:
    - Replaced 3rd `overrideTimedOut` boolean argument with a more generic object `opts` argument, which currently only

      `opts` argument will be treated as a legacy `overrideCompleted` argument
  - Changes to `timeout` and `timeoutAs` methods:
    - When the new `overrideUnstarted` option is set to:
      - `false` (the default), then the timeout will actually be suppressed if the task is still unstarted; or
      - `true`, then the timeout will be applied (even if the task is still unstarted.
    - When the new `reverseAttempt` option is set to:
      - `true`, then the timeout will "reverse the attempt" by decrementing the number of attempts, but ONLY if the task 
        was started; or
      - `false` (the default), then the timeout will leave the number of attempts as is

    & `opts` arguments
- Changes to `task-defs` module:
