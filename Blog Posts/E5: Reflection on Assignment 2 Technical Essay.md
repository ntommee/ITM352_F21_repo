<h3>Brief Introduction of the Assignment</h3>
<p>This assignment involved making a valid login and registration page. Users were required to have valid login information before being able to proceed to the invoice page. More information on this assignment can be found <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>I learned a lot more about how processing information on the server side works. Instead of making different pages for the login and registration pages, I chose to do everything on the server side. I thought it would be difficult at first, but with more careful thought, I could see how everything tied together.</p>

<h3>Partner</h3>
<p> I did not work with a partner for this assignment.</p>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>I did get help from Professor Port when I needed it. I needed help with minor details like getting errors to display on the registration and login pages. I also got help on getting everything to connect because I generated everything on the server. </p>

<h3>Assignment 1 vs. Assignment 2</h3>
<p>When I first started Assignment #1 I had no idea how everything on the server worked. I didn't have the greatest understanding of POST and GET; however, going into Assignment #2 I was very clear on how the server runs and this made it a lot easier for me to develop the new pages.</p>

<h3>Amount of Time Spent</h3>
<p>I spent probably 20% of the time thinking about how to do everything, another 20% of the time writing the code and the remaining 60% of the time was spent testing and debugging.</p>

<h3>What Went Well and What Didn't</h3>
<p>My overall thought process of the design for my registration and login pages went very well. I outlined everything and knew how to execute it. The debugging is what took me the longest time, so in the future I'd like to be able to debugg more efficiently.</p>

<h3>What I would do Differently</h3>
<p>I would seek help earlier. I spent a couple of days looking at my code to fix my errors myself, but I should have reached out for help sooner since it was very simple errors that were easy to fix.</p>
